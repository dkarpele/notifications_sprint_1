#### [architecture](architecture)

Architecture for the notifications service described here.

#### [notifications](notifications)

We use RabbitMQ as a broker and Sendgrid as an SMTP client. 

**Notify email**
- POST http://127.0.0.1/api/v1/notify-email/user-sign-up - send email notification to user after signing up

**Scheduler**
- likes_for_reviews. We send users an aggregated information about likes they received for their reviews to movies during last 24 hours. 

**Sendgrid**
With the help from Sendgrid we are sending individual and multiple emails. 
Sendgrid Marketing panel is used to send multiple emails to users from content manager.
